2. You should have received the SALT and API key from Traknpay.

### Server Side Setup

A hash is an encrypted value (checksum) that must be sent by the merchant in a payment request that is then sent back by PayUmoney in the payment response. A hash is used to protect transactions against “man in the middle” attacks.

Hash Generation for Payment Request
Use the following sample java sequence to generate a request hash.
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/traknpaypg/traknpaypg.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
